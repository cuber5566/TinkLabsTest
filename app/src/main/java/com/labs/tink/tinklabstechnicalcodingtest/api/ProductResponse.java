In 1963, Bob Dylan captured a rising tide of countercultural questioning in \u201cBlowin\u2019 in the Wind.\u201d Disaffected Gen Xers in the 1990s heard their doubts echoed in Kurt Cobain\u2019s way of saying, \u201cwhatever, nevermind.\u201d This year calls for something different: hot sauce hidden in a handbag and the determination to slay. Beyonc√©\u2019s musical act of self-affirmation \u2014 \u201ccatch my fly and my cocky fresh\u201d \u2014 is also a manifesto set to a laser-gun trap beat. The song announced Lemonade, the musical year\u2019s strongest call to think about the complexities of America\u2019s diasporic roots, and remains its most potent track. Rooted by producer Mike WiLL Made It in the trap music of today\u2019s South, it\u2019s a testament to African-American resilience in the face of storms and hate crimes, and to feminist erotic bravado grounded in economic self-reliance and communal vigilance.

The protagonist ends things, in part because she's tired of having to be someone she's not. The song builds to an epic chorus, in which Mitski slays her electric guitar and sings, \"you're an all-American boy / I guess I couldn't help trying to be your best American girl.\" In the end, she knows she doesn't need to apologize for who she is. \"Your mother wouldn't approve of how my mother raised me / But I do, I finally do,\" she sings. The song is brilliant for many reasons, but perhaps most of all for the way it forces us each to conjure up our \"all-American boy\" and then take issue with the fact that coming up with a picture of him was so easy.\r\n\r\n","updated":"2017-07-26T06:52:24.213582Z","created":"2017-07-26T06:52:24.213624Z"},{"id":3,"image":"https://drfdating.s3.amazonaws.com/images/941bef87-500c-47c2-a343-17dc7e755104.jpg","title":"Ultralight Beam","content":"\u201cThis is a God dream.\u201d There are many ways to take this core phrase from the most haunting song this year has offered, uttered by the troubled seeker whose 2016 was both deeply fruitful and frighteningly off-kilter: as an expression of Kanye West\u2019s desire to elevate himself beyond mere ego, or a way of sanctifying that ego; as a reminder of the need to honor the sacred or an assertion that secular music like his messy, vital, elusive, confrontational album The Life of Pablo can do that work while remaining true to the fallen spirit of the secular. As the track unfolds, West\u2019s utterance starts to feel like a stage direction. Over a track that sounds like a couple of church musicians fiddling on the organ and a snare drum in an unlit sanctuary, West offers different voices the chance to articulate their God dreams. A child preacher sampled from Instagram shouts out the Devil. R&B mainstays Terius Nash and Kelly Price sing of trying to keep faith despite feeling abandoned, leading into a ","updated":"2017-07-26T06:52:58.732042Z","created":"2017-07-26T06:52:58.732082Z"},{"id":4,"image":"https://drfdating.s3.amazonaws.com/images/28deb2c0-778e-498f-a604-a647486540c5.jpg","title":"You Want It Darker","content":"Leonard Cohen died with just enough life to witness the release of his 14th and final record, You Want It Darker. The title track, one of the finest of his singular career, is hymnal and testament. It tells a tale of humans at their worst, of futility and belief. Cohen\u2019s unmatched storytelling is why we revered him, but this one feels as if his intended audience was a higher power.\r\n\r\n","updated":"2017-07-26T06:53:40.874946Z","created":"2017-07-26T06:53:40.874985Z"},{"id":5,"image":"https://drfdating.s3.amazonaws.com/images/ed4bf0ec-8d50-4ee3-a5ff-4b8bb5edbe56.jpg","title":"What It Means","content":"Many activists rightly point out that it's white folks' duty to combat racism by engaging with other white folks. That's the sort of meaningful, necessary work that Drive-By Truckers, a Southern rock band whose fan base skews Caucasian, undertakes here. Patterson Hood grits his teeth with barely contained fury as he memorializes Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin over muddied open chords. But for all the righteous anger, this doesn't feel like sermonizing. The Truckers don't claim to have the answers; they just know that no one gets to dodge responsibility for the violence that killed those kids or the systems perpetuating it. \"What It Means\" is the kind of protest song we can wish were a relic of a bygone time. Yet as the names of black and brown Americans killed by police continue to become hashtags, it remains insistently, bitterly relevant.\r\n\r\n","updated":"2017-07-26T06:54:07.841287Z","created":"2017-07-26T06:54:07.841328Z"},{"id":6,"image":"https://drfdating.s3.amazonaws.com/images/63ece385-8c06-499c-b016-177ef1b19777.jpg","title":"Blessings (Reprise)","content":"\u201cBlessings (Reprise)\u201d is Chance the Rapper shedding the skin he used to wear as an average human being. In his words: \u201cThe people\u2019s champ must be everything the people can\u2019t be.\u201d He uses Coloring Book\u2019s outro as an opportunity to step into the glimmering suit of optimism he\u2019s been threading together since 2013\u2019s Acid Rap, which shone light on more dark days than bright ones. His positive outlook on life in the present has been hard-fought, but rewarding; it\u2019s apparent in his clarity that he\u2019s exactly where he wants to be. With minimal vocals underscoring his single verse, the Chi-Town golden child spits bar after bar of faithfulness, letting it be known that he\u2019s not afraid to talk to and about God in public. Chancellor Bennett is clearly a found man, and he\u2019s doing his best to lead his fans to the promised land of happiness and well-being.\r\n\r\n","updated":"2017-07-26T06:54:29.845046Z","created":"2017-07-26T06:54:29.845087Z"},{"id":7,"image":"https://drfdating.s3.amazonaws.com/images/8a1008ac-6820-4487-81ed-a3fcdab62da9.jpg","title":"Black Beatles","content":"If the first 10 seconds of Rae Sremmurd\u2019s \u201cBlack Beatles\u201d don\u2019t make you reach for your phone, congratulations: you\u2019ve managed to seclude yourself from a phenomenon. The song has become the designated background music of social media\u2019s latest takeover, the #mannequinchallenge. Started by a group of Black teenagers from Florida\u2019s Edward H. White High School, the experiment has spread across the country and been attempted by everyone from the Golden State Warriors to Hillary Clinton to Sir Paul McCartney. Over Mike WiLL Made It\u2019s undulating, laser beam-filled production, hip-hop\u2019s most electrifying duo and the resurrected Gucci Mane reimagine what it means to be famous and powerful, just like Black social influencers have done time and again through every medium available to them.\r\n\r\n","updated":"2017-07-26T06:54:52.346294Z","created":"2017-07-26T06:54:52.346333Z"},{"id":8,"image":"https://drfdating.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2fa6ea04-d412-461f-97e4-9704cafa3286.jpg","title":"Cranes In The Sky","content":"Solange Knowles has always had a voice. It rings out through her fashion choices, her myriad hair styles (don\u2019t touch it), her activism, and her intentionally molasses-slow pace of self-realization; her 2016 album A Seat at the Table was four years in the making, and features wisdom imparted by her parents and legendary New Orleans rap pioneer Master P. The record\u2019s lead single \u201cCranes in the Sky\u201d is a journal entry torn delicately from Solange\u2019s own notebook, dedicated to any person who\u2019s been faced with a deep sense of unfulfillment. Any person who\u2019s taken a long, hard look at the world and wondered, \u201cHow did we get here?\u201d Any person who\u2019s felt inexplicably alone while surrounded by millions of people. It\u2019s a rejuvenating elixir for the broken, but undefeated.\r\n\r\n","updated":"2017-07-26T06:55:18.417790Z","created":"2017-07-26T06:55:18.417829Z"},{"id":9,"image":"https://drfdating.s3.amazonaws.com/images/920f4c68-0b3e-4fed-889a-39cb365c9513.jpg","title":"Old Friends","content":"This Montclair, N.J. band masterfully tinges its emo-infused indie rock with traces of shambling country twang, placing plinking banjo and pedal steel alongside grungy guitar. But what makes a Pinegrove song like \"Old Friends\" powerful is Evan Stephens Hall's voice quivering with the slightest of drawls at the end of each line. It's easy to hear the frayed nerves and the emotional weight behind his words \u2014 and practically impossible not to shout right along with him. With a wry observational wit and poetic touch, Hall describes being both too tethered to his past and increasingly rootless as he grieves the loss of someone close.\r\n\r\n","updated":"2017-07-26T06:55:44.557544Z","created":"2017-07-26T06:55:44.557585Z"},{"id":10,"image":"https://drfdating.s3.amazonaws.com/images/e11f2be4-8a86-4537-98b6-479791efe71c.jpg","title":"Drone Bomb Me","content":"On HOPELESSNESS, ANOHNI places herself at the center of the world's devastation, personalizing everything from environmental catastrophe to a watchful government. She depicts herself as a willing victim who masochistically longs for the agony wrought by humanity's worst impulses. In \"Drone Bomb Me,\" that means laying out a collective death wish in bloody detail that's impossible to ignore.\r\n\r\n","updated":"2017-07-26T06:56:07.008692Z","created":"2017-07-26T06:56:07.008733Z"}]
